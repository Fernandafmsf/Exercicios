<h1>Programming Challenge</h1>
<h2>Challege given by Codesignal</h2>

<p>Given the string, check if it is a palindrome.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
For inputString = "aabaa", the output should be
solution(inputString) = true;
<br>
For inputString = "abac", the output should be
solution(inputString) = false;
<br>
For inputString = "a", the output should be
solution(inputString) = true.
</p>

<h2>What I've learned </h2>
