<h1>May's Second Challeng - Ballerini Community </h1>

<h2>The challenge </h2>

<p>Write a function to calculate the average of numbers in a list. </p>

<h2>What I've learned</h2>
<p>I learned that it is better to store the result of a function on a variable. I also learned how to verify if an input is really a number and not letters. </p>

<h2>What I still want to do</h2>
<p>I have to be able to check if the input is empty</p>
